# SVD with Trust Transitivity

In this repo, some experiments with SVD and SGD to help myself 
understand the process (i.e. by working through implementation).

Git repo is post-hoc, so there's not much "in-progress" here.

Experimented with encoding a trust transitivity semantic, which
seemed to perform slightly better than without, however after
writing this I've noticed the ground has been well-covered 
by (Yao et al. 2013). So I'll let this stay where it is.
